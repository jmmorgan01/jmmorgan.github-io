    <h1>Joseph M. Morgan</h1>
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Joseph M. Morgan. I am a aspiring programmer from North Carolina. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I grew up in a household with traditional Christian values, and I have a passion for MMA. I am straightforward and unafraid to speak my mind when necessary, and I value honesty and sincerity in my interactions with others. I prioritize maintaining a growth mindset, constantly seeking opportunities to learn and improve, and I view my failures as valuable lessons. While I may not have a strong prior work experience, I am dedicated to making a positive impact on my community and those around me through my academic pursuits. I am proud of my accomplishments in attending college and currently working towards an I.T degree. I am able to rise to the occasion, as demonstrated by my ability to complete a final project despite limited time and resources. In group projects, I take responsibility for ensuring everyone contributes and provide assistance when needed. I believe in staying organized and managing my time effectively to achieve success.

Outside of my studies, I am involved with an organization called Pathways Success Scholars at my college, which focuses on supporting male students of color in achieving their educational goals through relevant programming and professional experiences. Through this organization, I have gained valuable insights from individuals with diverse backgrounds and learned the importance of progress and helping others. I am not afraid to take action when necessary and have experience resolving conflicts among peers, creating a comfortable environment for everyone around me.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time, I enjoy Skate Boarding, MMA, Music, and I'm a advid fan of all kinds of videogames as well, I mainly enjoy fighting games as my favorite genre and as for my favorite games of all time would be Tekken 7 or the Street Fighter Series. For MMA, I mainly practiced Kick-Boxing, Muay Thai and Brazilian Jiu-jitsu, but I'm seeking to learn more about Boxing when I get the chance. As for music, I enjoy; RNB, Rap, Pop, Blues, Swing, Funk, Hip-Hop, Pop, Afro and Jazz. As for my involvement in communities, I am very involved in church, the church I go to is World Overcomers, I mainly volunteer on their Media Team whenever I am available. I mainly treat that place as my second home and I do all I can to support their efforts.
